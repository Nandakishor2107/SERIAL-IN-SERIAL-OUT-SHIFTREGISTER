# SERIAL-IN-SERIAL-OUT-SHIFTREGISTER

**AIM:**

To implement  SISO Shift Register using verilog and validating their functionality using their functional tables

**SOFTWARE REQUIRED:**

Quartus prime

**THEORY**

A SISO (Serial-In Serial-Out) Shift Register is a sequential logic circuit used for data storage and transfer. It takes input data serially, shifts it through a chain of flip-flops at every clock pulse, and outputs the data serially. This makes it suitable for applications requiring data serialization or delay.

**SISO shift Register**

A Serial-In Serial-Out shift register is a sequential logic circuit that allows data to be shifted in and out one bit at a time in a serial manner. It consists of a cascade of flip-flops connected in series, forming a chain. The input data is applied to the first flip-flop in the chain, and as the clock pulses, the data propagates through the flip-flops, ultimately appearing at the output.

The logic circuit provided below demonstrates a serial-in serial-out (SISO) shift register. It comprises four D flip-flops that are interconnected in a sequential manner. These flip-flops operate synchronously with one another, as they all receive the same clock signal.

The synchronous nature of the flip-flops ensures that the shifting of data occurs in a coordinated manner. When the clock signal rises, the input data is sampled and stored in the first flip-flop. On subsequent clock pulses, the stored data propagates through the flip-flops, moving from one flip-flop to the next.
Each D flip-flop in the circuit has a Data (D) input, a Clock (CLK) input, and an output (Q). The D input represents the data to be loaded into the flip-flop, while the CLK input is connected to the common clock signal. The output (Q) of each flip-flop is connected to the D input of the next flip-flop, forming a cascade.

**Procedure**

Step1: Define the specifications and initialize the design.
Step2: Declare the name of the entity and architecture by using VHDL source code.
Step3: Write the source code in VERILOG.
Step4: Check the syntax and debug the errors if found, obtain the synthesis report.
Step5: Verify the output by simulating the source code.
Step6: Write all possible combinations of input using the test bench.
Step7: Obtain the place and route report. 


**PROGRAM**

Program for flipflops and verify its truth table in quartus using Verilog programming.

```
module siso(din, clk, rst, dout);
 input din;
 input clk;
 input rst;
 output dout;
reg dout;
reg [7:0]x;
always @ (posedge(clk) or posedge(rst)) begin
if (rst==1'b1)
begin
dout=8'hzz;
end
else
begin
x={x[6:0],din};
dout=x[7];
end
end
endmodule

```

VERILOG code.
